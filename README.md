# Do actively cycling C and N pools depend ultimately on soil P supply? Across-biome synthesis

## PIs: 

- Craig See, Postdoctoral Scientist, Northern Arizona University
- Ellery Vaughan, Postdoctoral Scientist, Northern Arizona University
- Ruth Yanai, Professor, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry

## Project Summary

- https://lternet.edu/working-groups/soil-p-control-of-c-and-n/

## Scripted Workflow

1. Harmonize - Using [GoogleSheet Data Key](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fJswJ876A1LfFbiwJJ9aJp-Bvl0QEdzjMThOWEHkQUU/edit#gid=402780056), combine all raw data files. Creates archival data in long format.

2. Wrangle P Fractions - Sum P fractions conditionally by dataset to create relevant P sums (e.g., "total", "slow", etc.)

3. Attach Ancillary Data - Join on ancillary data to the data created by step 2 for use in statistics/visualization

4. Statistics Prep - Subset the data made by step 3 into scientifically-relevant groups for testing particular hypotheses

5. Calculate Averages - Accept _all_ 'stats-ready' files and average to both plot- and site-level

6A. Graphs - Make graphs/figures from the data created by step 4 and 5

6B. Statistics - Perform statistics on data (likely only data from step 4 but maybe step 5 too)
